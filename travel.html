    <p style="color:rgb(214, 94, 210);"> Many people travel for different purposes. Whether it is for a business trip or a holiday trip, we see people travelling often. Some people prefer a hilly area for travelling while the others like travelling to places with beaches. In this travelling essay, we will look at the importance of travelling and how it has changed ever since the old times.

      <h2 style="color: orange;">ACCOMMODATION:</h2> 
        <p style="color:indigo"> 
            Every traveler needs to find somewhere to lay their head, whether it's a place to pitch a tent or a luxury suite in a fancy resort. There's a vast array of accommodation options to choose from, and you have to decide whether to book ahead or look for accommodation after you arrive at the destination.

        <h2 style="color: indianred;">EVENTS:</h2> 
        <p style="color:papayawhip"> See what festivals and events are scheduled, whether they be music, sport or any other topic. Find out when and where they will be happening.

     <h2 style="color: orange;">ACTIVITIES:</h2>
        <p style="color:navy">Many travelers seek out destinations that are particularly suited to specific activities, such as scuba diving or rock climbing. Some of these travel activities require specific gear, training, or planning to pursue, while others may be as simple as slipping into a warm spring to enjoy the soothing waters

        <h2 style="color:crimson;">HEALTH:</h2> 
        <p style="color:rgb(67, 206, 206)">Health is an issue that affects all travellers, especially to off-the-beaten-path destinations. General common-sense rules apply to all travel. Consult with your doctor beforehand if you have preexisting conditions, verify what insurance coverage you have when away from home, carry a sufficient supply of any medications, and bring copies of your prescriptions in case of loss

        <h2 style="color: peru;">TRAVELLING WITH CHILDREN:</h2> 
        <p style="color:green;">Travelling as a family allows experiences to be shared. It can add interest to family time together away from the pressures of work and education. You can gain different perspectives on places when travelling in a group with children. It is often easier to get to meet local people, people can be friendlier, and when picking educational experiences for children you often learn something yourself.
